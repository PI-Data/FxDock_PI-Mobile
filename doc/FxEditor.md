# FxEditor

Nearly all Java text editors, Swing and FX alike, suffer from one deficiency: inability to work with large 
data models.

The goal of this project is to provide an FX text component that does not have such a limitation.  The main idea
is to use a line-oriented data model and FX-style virtual flow rendering.
